                    <p>Overall, we believe our current prototype of our product will truly reach our customers when hitting the market. The product we developed is multifaceted, which adds to its uniqueness and effectiveness. The nitrate detector doubles as both a detector and purifier of water, as  chemicals aid in the detection of nitrate, and activated carbon allows for water samples to have nitrate cleansed from them. This is a vital aspect of our solution no company has addressed yet. While nitrate test kits do exist, they are never as easy to understand while truly removing and filtering nitrate. Likewise, while nitrate filtration systems exist, they must be installed to pipes and other water sources, and never actually detect or test for nitrate.<br></br>

In order to properly market our solution, our team developed a website, as its global reach allows us to connect and aid more people. This website empowered us not only by helping us connect with editing customers, but also reach out to new ones. This way, updates, instructions, new features and products, and customer feedback was available. It allowed us to improve our product, and customers to properly use our product. <br></br>

In order to truly receive customer feedback, and see how far our demand has grown, our team made multiple polls, including an instagram poll and a google form poll. Our asked question was whether they believe a nitrate filtration and detection system would be beneficial to oneâ€™s health. On Instagram, we had an overwhelming 81 responses, ouof which 84% were a yes. On google forms, we had 18 responses, our of which 83% responded saying yes. While students are not our primary target audience, many of them reflected what their parents believed, some even going as far as asking their parents, who are a part of our target audience, as many homes do not have proper nitrate filters. <br></br>

Our overwhelming support for our product shows its future success. By making our product easy to use without any prior knowledge, easy to read and understand, and safe, it is a product applicable to everyone, and helps keep everyone safe. In addition, the support represented how our marketing website campaign had worked as well. By advertising our website, we were able to get our customers interested in our product, and allowed them to have prior knowledge of our solution before its release. <br></br>

However, if we were given more time, we would definitely put our idea to the physical world. While we have researched our chemicals, CADet our idea, and designed a marketing campaign, we are yet to truly build our solution. We would definitely strive to put our product to the physical world, and continue to add new features, such as installable cartridges with chemicals, to help ensure the safety, reliability, and easiness of our product for our customers.<br></br>
