                    <p>In order to show our product design, we designed our prototype on Fusion 360. The CAD (computer-aided design) process was very similar to the way in which we developed our actual solution. Although we were able to identify the way our solution functioned, we still needed to understand what exactly it would look like. As a result, we had several different iterations of the design. We had to figure out how the water would mix with cadmium to create a solution, and identify how this solution would flow into the chemicals that form the red dye. All in all, the CAD process mirrored the solution development process. <br></br>
In order to inform customers on how to use our product online, we also developed a website. This website was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. By allowing customers to have a visual interface that helped teach them to operate this product, we felt we had a higher chance of increasing customer satisfaction. Furthermore, we also had a reliable way to make sure users worked safely and properly with our materials. By utilizing a type of communication a majority of people could connect to, we hold the ability to alert people from across the globe of new variations, designs, and updates to our product. However, this is not just a major benefit for our customer. Through our website, customers can contact our team on potential updates and give feedback on our product, allowing us to refine our design.

                    <p>After our numerous prototypes and designs, we have finally arrived at our strongest, most current version of our design, which we feel can be placed on the market. In our current design, we have two containers, one storing cadmium, an element used to reduce nitrate to nitrite (nitrite is more reactive), and another storing sulfanilic acid and alpha naphthylamine. The user would pour the testing sample into container 1, containing cadmium. After its reduction, water continues to flow into container 2, where it is met by the the acid mixture. If nitrate, now reduced to nitrite, is present in the water, it will react to form a red dye, allowing the user to visibly see that nitrate is present. Unlike monitoring systems, the red dye, and the darkness of red dye, can immediately alert the user about whether the water is safe to consume. It requires no knowledge of nitrate data analysis, and allows for a quick and easy process.<br>
                </br> This prototype also included a filtration system. This filtration system contained a tube packed with activated carbon attached to the side of the tester. As customers poured contaminated water down the tube, the activated carbon would react to remove nitrate. One analysis by the company TAPP showed that activated carbon could remove up to 70% of nitrates in water (TAPP, 2021). No other nitrate test kit truly tests and filters nitrate. Furthermore, a metal mesh was included on top of the pipe, reducing large debris like algae, often found in water sources with lare nitrate buildups.
