                    <p>Nitrate contamination up to 10mL/L is considered safe drinking water by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), higher numbers pose such health risks (health.state, 2021, p1). A major factor behind the buildup of nitrates in water sources is the overuse of fertilizers from farms, as the chemicals wash into water sources through means called runoffs. Furthermore, even those fertilizers advertised as nitrate-free stimulate the growth of nitrate producing bacteria, which in turn also increase nitrate growth in water supplies. Manmade sources, such as wells, also increase potential risks of nitrate poisoning, as poorly planned sources, such as wells, can tap into underground nitrate buildups (Minnesota Health 2021)r. As the nitrate levels in water sources rise, they pose more and more of a threat to human life. <br></br>

Nitrate testing kits are easily accessible on the market, and can report the contamination of a water sample in less than 5 minutes. A common example of a nitrate testing kit is the API Nitrate Test Kit, designed for both fresh and saltwater aquariums. This test includes a small glass tube in order to test a sample of aquarium water, and two drop bottles containing liquids enough for 90 tests (API Fish Care 2019). Based on the color of the water after adding the liquid, one can tell the pH of their aquarium. However, this solution is designed for aquarium fish, who thrive in pH levels of 6.5 and 9.0, meaning the level of nitrate in that water is possibly higher than the human body is capable of handling (7.35 to 7.45 pH) (Aqueon 2020). Thus, this kit serves the risk of displaying a safe test when the pH level is actually much too high for human drinking. In addition, while this kit reports data, it has no means of actually filtering nitrate and other debris out from the water to make water drinkable, and is also incapable of surveying large amounts of water data, as bigger water sources result in bigger survey samples.<br></br>

Another example of a nitrate test is a nitrate monitor, designed to be put in water and report nitrate concentration. While low end monitors exist, a high end monitor capable of testing and reporting numbers is the Eutech Ion 6+ (Eutech Institute 2021). This is a portable monitor that clearly and efficiently reports nitrate levels in water, through a LCD screen. The use of technology here allows for an infinite amount of tests. However, to the average person without a background in Environmental Sciences, these numbers would be meaningless, and the safe, known range would remain unknown. By being able to represent data through colors, customers can easily relate them to signs of contamination and danger, whereas past education is required for numerical data. Furthermore, this solution also has no way of filtration, and does not properly decontaminate a water sample, as it only returns values, and is also incapable of working without electricity. <br></br>
